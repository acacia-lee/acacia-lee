👋 Hi, I’m Acacia! (@acacia-lee)

Graduate of Google UX/UI Certification and aspiring front-end web dev.

Constantly learning new things. (HTML? ✔️ Css? ✔️ Java Script? 🛠️ Forever a work in progress.) 
If you ever feel like helping out a rookie, I'm all ears - and probably surrounded by a pile of empty coffee cups and up to my ears in error codes.
